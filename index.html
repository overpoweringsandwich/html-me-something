                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                    <p> Back when I was a lad(about 13 years old), I began building computers with my friends for gaming.
                        On the weekends we would setup LANs in my friends basement. After a while we began to understand how to manipulate
                        different features of the game. We began experimenting with making adjustments to our systems, maintaining them etc.
                        After learning more about hardware, we became more interested in how software worked. My friend David even started
                        becoming proficient in C++. I dabbled in python and visual basic, we were enjoying what we could do.</p>

                <h2>Computers &amp; Real Life</h2>
                    <p>Eventually we stopped spending as much time learning about computers, and just casually gamed. We became busier
                    with things such as college and careers, so our energy was elsewhere. I didn't think that
                    I would get into computers as a career, and chose business as my major. Although, computers were always still
                    interesting to me, so I still decided to get into the software industry. </p>

                <h2>Post-College</h2>
                    <p>After I finished my degree, I looked to the software companies for sales and consulting positions. I quickly
                    learned I didn't find the sales process interesting, nor did I see myself doing this as a career. I started to think about
                    what else I might enjoy doing, and computer programming was one of those ideas. After looking into different possibilities,
                    I put together a plan. Thankfully, that plan landed me at LaunchCode.</p>

                    <p>Today I'm a student at LaunchCode, am enjoying what I'm learning to do, and looking forward to career opportunities.
                    So far it's been awesome!</p>
