                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                    <p> Back when I was a wee lad(about 13 years old), I began building computers with my friends for gaming.
                        We would often setup LANs in my friends basement. After a while we had begun to understand how to manipulate
                        different features of the game. We began experimenting with making adjustments to our systems, maintaining them etc.
                        After learning more about hardware, we became more interested in how software worked. My friend David even started
                        becoming proficient in C++. We began spending more time learning.</p>

                <h2>Computers &amp; Real Life</h2>
                    <p>Eventually we stopped spending as much time learning about computers, and just casually gamed. Life became busier,
                    and things such as careers, college, and our adult lives became the focal point for our energy. I didn't think that
                    I would get into computers as a career, so I chose business as my major. Although, computers were always still
                    interesting to me. </p>

                <h2>Post-College</h2>
                    <p>After I finished my degree, I looked to the software industry for sales and consulting positions. I quickly
                    learned that I didn't find this interesting, nor did I see myself doing this as a career. I started to think about
                    what else I might enjoy doing, and computer programming was one of those ideas. After looking into different possibilities,
                    I put together a plan. Thankfully, that plan landed me at LaunchCode.</p>

                    <p>Today I am a student at LaunchCode, and am enjoying what I do and where I'm going.
                    So far it's been rad!</p>
